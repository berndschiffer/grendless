Backlog (the more important the more at the top):

   * Bug: NumberFormatException is not shown if thrown in a test.
   * Slider should slow down a little bit, so one could see better with only few tests from green to green bar.
   * Write a bug report because result.getIgnoreCount() seems to be broken.
