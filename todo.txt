Backlog (the more important the more at the top):

   * Bug: NumberFormatException is not shown if thrown in a test.
   * Write a bug report because result.getIgnoreCount() seems to be broken.

What is wanted:
   * Grendless should do with JUnit-Tests in Java, what it does for JUnit-Tests in Groovy right now. (Chris W. 01/13/2010)
