Backlog (the more important the more at the top):

   * Slider should slow down a little bit, so one could see better with only few tests from green to green bar.
   * Write a bug report because result.getIgnoreCount() seems to be broken.

   * Grendless should do with JUnit-Tests in Java, what it does for JUnit-Tests in Groovy right now. (Chris W. 01/13/2010)
